# **Algorithms Data Structures - Java Implementation**

Welcome to the **Algorithms Data Structures Java Implementation** project! This is an **open-source** initiative where we focus on providing **Java implementations** for various data structures that currently do not have a Java version on the [The Algorithms website](https://the-algorithms.com/).

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to contribute to the **Algorithms** community by implementing key **data structures** in Java that are either missing or need enhancement. The project is open to contributions from developers of all skill levels, whether you're new to programming or an experienced software engineer. We hope this project will serve as both a **learning resource** and a valuable addition to the broader open-source community.

## **Goals of the Project**

- **Identify**: We identify data structures that do not have existing Java implementations on **The Algorithms** website.
- **Implement**: We add Java implementations for these missing or incomplete data structures.
- **Contribute**: We contribute these implementations back to the **open-source community** to help improve the overall resource available to learners and developers.

## **Features**

Implementations of common and advanced **data structures** such as:
- **Trees** (e.g., Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
- **Graphs** (e.g., Adjacency Lists, Adjacency Matrices)
- **Heaps** (e.g., Min/Max Heaps)
- **Hash Tables**
- **Linked Lists** (e.g., Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)
- And many more...

## **Contribution Guide**

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help us improve the repository or add more data structures, here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Choose a Data Structure**: Pick a data structure from **The Algorithms** website that doesn't already have a Java implementation in our repository.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the chosen data structure in **Java**.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're done, submit a pull request for review.

## **How to Run the Code**

### **Clone the Repository**:

git clone https://github.com/SlyyJavii/TheAlgorithmJava.git

Compile and Run: Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed. You can compile and run the code from the terminal
